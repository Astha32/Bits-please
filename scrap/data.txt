<div class="qwjRop"><div><div class="">I don't think you'll find a better mobile at this price range. As most of you know the pros &amp; cons of this mobile, I would just mention 1 con this phone has (identified as of now), i.e., unless I increased complete brightness in bright daylight, I'm unable to view the display properly compared to Samsun M30 (no need to increase the brightness). Rest assured, this Pro is a Pro in all the segments &amp; features. Kudos.<br/><br/>Image below was clicked in more than 90% darkness. Came out really well.</div><span class="_2jRR3v"><span>READ MORE</span></span></div></div>,
